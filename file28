Repository (Repo): A Git repository is a directory that contains all of your projectâ€™s files and the entire version history.
Commit: A snapshot of your changes. Every time you commit, you save your current work in the history of the repository.
Branch: A separate line of development. You can create branches to work on features or bug fixes independently from the main project (usually called main or master).
Merge: The process of combining different branches or changes into one.
Remote: A version of the repository hosted online (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
