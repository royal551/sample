greet(): A simple function that prints a greeting message.
checkEvenOdd(int number): Takes an integer as input and checks if it's even or odd.
Main Method: This is where the program starts running.
We call greet() to print a greeting.
We declare an integer and check if itâ€™s even or odd using the checkEvenOdd() method.
A loop prints numbers from 1 to 5.
Finally, we demonstrate iterating over an array using an enhanced for loop.
